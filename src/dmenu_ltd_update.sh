Look in ~/missing_list for a list of programs that 
should show in dmenu_ltd_cat_run.sh but do not.
Example of how to correct: 
If firefox is shown as missing, open $appinfo/firefox.desktop
Go to the line beggining with the word Categories. 
Remove at least one word in the ; seperated list from the 
$dmenu_ltd_dir/destroy.txt
If you can't find the file in $appinfo (in this example thats unlikely 
in most circumstances) look for $custom_dir/firefox
Then run me again.
If its not there either, then theres a bug over here somewhere. Oops.
